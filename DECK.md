> A pure function is one that exhibits the property of substitution: replacing a call with its returned value should make the program equivalent. As an example, `concat('hello', 'world')` can be substituted with `'hello world'` without changing the behavior of your program.

> How can we apply this to a graphical user interface? By having the function return an abstract representation of widgets (or markup) to be rendered on the screen...
