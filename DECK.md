> “Basscss is an atomic class based CSS library... A very good one! But I really hated it at the time. But I don’t hate it anymore!”

React

---

Pure UI

---

> “A pure function is one that exhibits the property of substitution: replacing a call with its returned value should make the program equivalent. As an example, `concat('hello', 'world')` can be substituted with `'hello world'` without changing the behavior of your program.

> “How can we apply this to a graphical user interface? By having the function return an abstract representation of widgets (or markup) to be rendered on the screen...”

- [Guillermo Rauch *Pure UI*](https://rauchg.com/2015/pure-ui)

Self-contained & Stateless

<!--
> self-contained (modular): it can be deployed independently – note that it may cooperate with other components, but dependent components are replaceable

> stateless: it treats each request as an independent transaction, unrelated to any previous request. Stateless is just one technique; managed state and transactional systems can also be composable, but with greater difficulty.
